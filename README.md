# Bio Inspired Spaceship

Run "main.py" in order to launch the NEAT or the GP process and find the best NN or the best program for commanding the spaceship.
This can be done by specifying the arguments `--neat` or `--gp`.

It is possible to load our best results using the arguments `--run_best_neat` and `--run_best_gp`.
