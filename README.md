# Yellow Spaceship!
Thank you for downloading Yellow Spaceship!
This is the first "real" pygame game I ever made and I hope you enjoy it.
You can either run the game in a python IDE using the .py files which you can download from the master branch (make sure all of them and the data folder are in the same directory) by just run "main.py".
If you dont have python or pygame installed, you can also download "Yellow Spaceship! Installer.exe" from the exe branch, which will install a standalone executable.
For further information on how to contact me check out the "Credit" tab inside the game.
Thank you once again for downloading it and have fun playing it!
